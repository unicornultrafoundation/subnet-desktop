#!/bin/bash
# This script is executed by the applet with root permissions.
# The caller will have created a temporary directory containing just the
# `sudo-prompt-command` shell script. This script will add the `code`,
# `stdout` and `stderr` files. The caller will delete this directory
# again after reading the files.

# Set sudo timestamp for subsequent sudo calls if tty_tickets are disabled:
/bin/mkdir -p /var/db/sudo/$USER > /dev/null 2>&1
/usr/bin/touch /var/db/sudo/$USER > /dev/null 2>&1
# AppleScript's "do shell script" may alter stdout line-endings.
# It may also set stdout to stderr if there was a non-zero return code and no stderr.
# We therefore prefer to redirect output streams and capture return code manually:
/bin/bash sudo-prompt-command 1>stdout 2>stderr
/bin/echo $? > code
# Correct ownership of stdout, stderr and code so that user can delete them:
/usr/sbin/chown $USER stdout stderr code
# Always return 0 so that AppleScript does not show error dialog:
exit 0
