# This script is used to launch (busybox) init on WSL2 through network-setup process.
# The network-setup process starts the vm-switch and unshare as its sub processes. this
# is necessary since we need to do some mount namespace, since we store the data on the
# WSL shared mount (/mnt/wsl/rancher/desktop/) and that can have issues with
# lingering tmpfs mounts after we exit.  This means we need to run this script
# under unshare (to get a private mount namespace), and then we can mark various
# mount points as shared (for buildkit).  Kubelet will internally do some
# tmpfs mounts for volumes (secrets, etc.), which will stay private and go away
# once k3s exits, so that we can delete the data as necessary.
